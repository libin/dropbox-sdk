    # Uploads a file to a server.  This uses the HTTP PUT upload method for simplicity
    #
    # Arguments:
    # * to_path: The directory path to upload the file to. If the destination
    #   directory does not yet exist, it will be created.
    # * file_obj: A file-like object to upload. If you would like, you can 
    #   pass a string as file_obj.
    # * overwrite: Whether to overwrite an existing file at the given path. [default is False]
    #   If overwrite is False and a file already exists there, Dropbox
    #   will rename the upload to make sure it doesn't overwrite anything.
    #   You must check the returned metadata to know what this new name is.
    #   This field should only be True if your intent is to potentially
    #   clobber changes to a file that you don't know about.
    # * parent_rev: The rev field from the 'parent' of this upload. [optional]
    #   If your intent is to update the file at the given path, you should
    #   pass the parent_rev parameter set to the rev value from the most recent
    #   metadata you have of the existing file at that path. If the server
    #   has a more recent version of the file at the specified path, it will
    #   automatically rename your uploaded file, spinning off a conflict.
    #   Using this parameter effectively causes the overwrite parameter to be ignored.
    #   The file will always be overwritten if you send the most-recent parent_rev,
    #   and it will never be overwritten you send a less-recent one.
    # Returns:
    # * a Hash containing the metadata of the newly uploaded file.  The file may have a different name if it conflicted.
    #
    # Simple Example
    #  client = DropboxClient(session, "app_folder")
    #  #session is a DropboxSession I've already authorized
    #  client.put_file('/test_file_on_dropbox', open('/tmp/test_file'))
    # This will upload the "/tmp/test_file" from my computer into the root of my App's app folder
